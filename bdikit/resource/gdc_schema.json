Upon administration and cellular uptake of NUC-7738 by passive diffusion, cordycepin monophosphate (3'-dAMP) is converted into its active anti-cancer metabolite 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). 3'-dATP functions as a ribonucleoside analogue and competes with ATP during transcription. Therefore, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, inhibits cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Also, 3'-dAMP activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. This prevents the hyperphosphorylation of the translation repressor protein 4E-BP1. This results in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. Compared to cordycepin alone, the addition of the phosphoramidate moiety may overcome cancer resistance and allow for greater cytotoxicity as NUC-7738 does not require a nucleoside transporter for cellular uptake, is independent of  enzymatic activation by adenosine kinase (AK) and is not susceptible to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase (ADA). Altogether, this may help overcome cancer resistance to cordycepin.",

Upon intramuscular administration of the Ad5/F35-hGCC-PADRE, the Ad5/F35 targets CD46, which is expressed widely on most tumor cells, and the virus is taken up by cells. Once inside the cells, the virus expresses hGCC. The expressed hGCC induces both humoral and cellular immune responses against tumor cells expressing the hGCC antigen. This results in the immune-mediated killing of tumor cells. The hGCC protein is normally restricted to intestinal epithelial cells but is overexpressed by metastatic colorectal tumors.

Using TALEN technology, the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain (TRAC) and CD52 genes are deleted from the CAR T-cells. Upon administration, the allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR-transduced T-cells ALLO-715 specifically recognize and induce selective toxicity in BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). BCMA is found on the surfaces of plasma cells, is overexpressed on malignant plasma cells and plays a key role in plasma cell proliferation and survival. Deletion of the CD52 gene makes the modified donor T-cells resistant to an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody treatment, that is used during lymphodepletion. The knockout of TRAC eliminates TCR expression and is intended to abrogate the potential induction of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) by the donor T-cells. The donor-derived, gene-edited CAR T cells have reduced production times and have increased availability when compared to autologous CAR-T cells, which use the patient's own cells and are produced on an individual basis. In addition, if the ALLO-715 cells cause unacceptable side effects, the incorporated CD20-based off-switch permits selective depletion of the ALLO-715 cells when the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is administered.",

Upon administration, anti-CD39 monoclonal antibody SRF617 specifically binds to the CD39 antigen, thereby preventing the conversion and degradation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This leads to an increase in the extracellular levels of immunogenic ATP and a decrease in the levels of immunosuppressive adenosine within the tumor microenvironment (TME). A high level of ATP increases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and promotes both T-cell proliferation and the stimulation of dendritic and other myeloid-derived cells that are necessary for innate and adaptive immunity. CD39, a cell surface ectonucleosidase, is upregulated on tumor cells as an immune evasion strategy. Blocking its action may improve anti-tumor immune responses.",

Upon administration of anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody TG-1801, the anti-CD19 moiety selectively targets and binds to CD19 on CD19-positive B-cells, thereby improving binding of the anti-CD47 moiety to the CD19+ malignant B-cells. The CD47 binding by TG-1801 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis.

Additionally, blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response and T-cell-mediated killing of CD19/CD47-expressing tumor cells.

Upon administration of anti-PD-1/CD47 infusion protein HX009, the agent simultaneously and selectively targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on T-lymphocytes and CD47 on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by HX009 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1 blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore effector T-cell functions and may further activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell killing. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-1, HX009 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis.

Upon administration, anti-PD1/CTLA4 bispecific antibody MEDI5752 targets and binds to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. In addition, MEDI5752 is internalized and is able to degrade PD-1. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with MEDI5752 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone.

In turn, IL-15 stimulates the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells locally in the TME, which induces an anti-tumor immune response. This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and on many cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1, a negative regulator of the immune system on activated T-cells, limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.",

Upon reintroduction into the patient, the autologous CD19/PD-1 bispecific CAR-T cells target and bind to CD19 and the PD-1 ligands, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), expressed on tumor cells. The binding to CD19 leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CD19-expressing tumor cells and cell lysis of these cells. The binding of the PD1/CD28 chimera to PD-L1 prevents the normal PD1/PD-L1-mediated T-cell suppression and, instead, promotes signaling through the CD28 domain, which results in the stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This enhances T-lymphocyte proliferation and anti-tumor activity. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen overexpressed in B-cell lineage malignancies. PD-1 protein, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity. It plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis.

Upon administration of belantamab mafodotin, the anti-BCMA antibody moiety selectively binds to BCMA on tumor cell surfaces. Upon internalization, the MMAF moiety binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, which results in G2/M phase arrest and induces tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, belantamab mafodotin induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, this results in the inhibition of cellular proliferation in tumor cells that overexpress BCMA. BCMA, a receptor for a proliferation-inducing ligand and B-cell activating factor, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and plays a key role in plasma cell survival; it is found on the surfaces of plasma cells and overexpressed on malignant plasma cells.

The monoclonal antibody portion of the anti-CD25 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) ADCT-301 specifically binds to the cell surface antigen CD25. This causes the internalization of ADCT-301 and the subsequent release of the cytotoxic PBD moiety. The imine groups of the PBD moiety bind to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of DNA. This induces interstrand cross-links in the minor groove of DNA and inhibits DNA replication, which inhibits the proliferation of CD25-overexpressing tumor cells.

Upon administration, chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing CAR T-lymphocytes are re-directed to specific tumor cells in the brain inducing selective toxicity in these tumor cells. CLTX, a 36-amino acid peptide found in the venom of the deathstalker scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and a chloride channel blocker, preferentially binds to glioma (and other neuroectodermal origin) cells via membrane bound forms of the endopeptidase matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). This may direct the T-lymphocytes to and induce selective toxicity in MMP-2-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, binding to MMP-2 on glioma cells may both interfere with transmembrane chloride exchange and inhibit proteolytic extracellular matrix remodeling by MMP-2, which may further limit the spread of these tumor cells. MMP-2 is specifically upregulated in gliomas and related cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain. The CD28 co-stimulatory molecule signaling domain enhances activation and signaling; its inclusion may increase proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity compared to the inclusion of the CD3 zeta chain alone. IgG4-Fc (EQ) contains two point mutations in its spacer region which prevents recognition of the CAR by Fc receptors (FcRs) without altering the ability of the CAR to mediate antigen-specific lysis. CD19t, which lacks the cytoplasmic signaling tail, provides a non-immunogenic surface marker that allows for accurate measurement, efficient cell tracking and/or imaging of the therapeutic T-cells in vivo following adoptive transfer. Additionally, co-expression of CD19t functions as a \"suicide\" switch via clinically available antibodies or immunotoxins which can be used to selectively eliminate the genetically modified cells.",

This may increase the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and decrease the expression of co-inhibitory molecules on T-cells leading to increased production of cytokines and chemokines by T-cells, decreased proliferation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and abrogation of tumor-induced immunosuppression. This ultimately induces a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells and leads to a reduction in tumor cell growth.

Upon administration, BTX-A51 binds to and inhibits the activity of CK1alpha, CDK7, and CDK9. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of CK1alpha prevents the enhanced binding of murine double minute X (MDMX) to p53, the formation of CK1alpha and MDM2 complex, and the resulting inhibition of p53. This induces p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, slowing tumor cell proliferation. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of CDK7 and CDK9 prevents the positive transcription elongation factor b (PTEFb)-mediated activation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and leads to the inhibition of gene transcription of various anti-apoptotic proteins. This also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, slowing tumor cell proliferation. CK1alpha, a serine/threonine kinase and a leukemic stem cell target, acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through the negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and p53. It negatively regulates p53 by phosphorylating MDMX, thus enhancing binding of MDMX to p53, as well as by forming a complex with MDM2. CDK7, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and promotes the expression of key oncogenes such as c-Myc through the phosphorylation of RNA Pol II. CDK9, also a serine/threonine kinase, regulates elongation of transcription through phosphorylation of RNA Pol II at serine 2 (p-Ser2-RNAPII).

Upon subcutaneous administration of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj, daratumumab targets and binds to CD38 on certain CD38-expressing tumors, such as multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia. This binding induces direct apoptosis through Fc-mediated cross-linking and triggers immune-mediated tumor cell lysis through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) immune responses. CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineage cells. Hyaluronidase-fihj hydrolyzes and degrades the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), thereby decreasing interstitial viscosity and enhancing penetration of daratumumab through the interstitial space. This facilitates the delivery of daratumumab to CD38-expressing tumor cells.",

Upon oral administration of tdecitabine and cedazuridine, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown of decitabine, increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing GI toxicity due to the administration of lower doses of decitabine. Decitabine exerts its antineoplastic activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate form into DNA, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase and results in hypomethylation of DNA.

Upon intratumoral administration of delolimogene mupadenorepvec, the virus infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells. This causes direct oncolysis and the release of a plethora of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells. The released TAAs stimulate the immune system and activate anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby further killing tumor cells. In addition, infected tumor cells and tumor stroma cells, including stellate cells and infiltrating immune cells, express the immunostimulants CD40L and 4-1BBL. The expressed CD40L and 4-1BBL proteins activate the CD40L- and 4-1BBL-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. This activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages. The DCs produce various cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL12), IL21, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), and interferon-gamma (IFNg), which leads to the activation and expansion of both T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Altogether, this modulates immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), disrupts tumor stroma, and causes additional immune stimulation against tumor cells, thereby inducing further tumor cell lysis. In addition, CD40L reduces myeloid suppressor cells in the TME. Inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/35 fiber targets CD46 and increases viral uptake in cells. Transgene expression is driven by a separate promoter to allow for efficient expression in both tumor cells and tumor stroma. Replication is restricted to tumor cells by the presence of the delta24 mutation in the E1A gene, which deletes the retinoplastoma protein (pRb)-binding domain and forces viral replication to be conditional on hyperphosphorylated pRb and a dysfunctional Rb pathway.",

Upon administration of AZD0466, AZD4320 is released through hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. AZD4320 is a Bcl2-homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic that specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. This restores apoptotic processes and inhibits cell proliferation in Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-dependent tumor cells. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family that are overexpressed in many cancers, play an important role in the negative regulation of apoptosis.

This increases chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity leading to enhanced tumor cell death. AZD7648 may also increase the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and may work as a monotherapy in tumors with high endogenous levels of DNA damage resulting from defects in other DNA repair pathways.

Upon oral administration, the DNA-PK/PI3K-delta inhibitor BR101801 inhibits the activity of both PI3K-delta and DNA-PK. This prevents PI3K-mediated signaling pathways and may lead to the inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K-overexpressing tumor cells. Specifically, since PI3K regulates c-myc expression, inhibition of PI3K signaling may lead to a decrease in proliferation of c-myc-expressing tumor cells. Also, by inhibiting the activity of DNA-PK, this agent interferes with the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) process and prevents the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity by inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA. The PI3K pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumors and plays an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, growth, and survival. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and plays a key role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks.

This prevents the interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4, blocks CXCR4 activation, and may result in decreased proliferation and migration in CXCR4-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow into the blood.  In addition, dociparstat sodium prevents the interaction of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) with its ligands, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), Mac-1(CD11b/CD18), the nuclear pro-inflammatory protein high mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1), carboxymethyl lysine-bovine serum albumin (CML-BSA) and members of the S100 calgranulin family. In addition, this agent inhibits the enzymes heparanase, cathepsin G, and human leukocyte elastase, which are involved in inflammation and metastasis. Altogether, this may inhibit tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis. Dociparstat sodium also binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4 or CXCL4) and may prevent PF4's inhibitory effect on platelet production. This may increase platelet production. Unlike heparin, this agent does not induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). RAGE, a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in inflammation and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family that plays an important role in chemotaxis, chemoresistance and angiogenesis, and is upregulated in several tumor cell types.

Upon oral administration of DTRM-555, the DTRMWXHS-12 component inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, and leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. BTK plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival of B-lymphocytes. The everolimus component binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that binds to and inhibits the activation of mTOR, a key regulatory kinase. Upregulated in some tumors, mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating cellular proliferation, motility, and survival that is located downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The pomalidomide component may inhibit TNF-alpha production, enhance the activity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, pomalidomide may inhibit tumor angiogenesis, promote cell cycle arrest in susceptible tumor cell populations, and stimulate erythropoiesis.

In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.",

Upon subcutaneous administration, hyaluronidase-zzxf temporarily breaks down the hyaluronan barrier, which decreases viscosity of, and allows both pertuzumab and trastuzumab to spread rapidly through the interstitial space. This improves access to lymphatic and capillary vessels and facilitates the absorption of both antibodies into the bloodstream. Pertuzumab targets and binds to the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2 and blocks ligand-dependent heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3 and HER4. This inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling and prevents the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, respectively. Trastuzumab targets and binds to subdomain IV of HER2 and inhibits ligand-independent, HER2 mediated cell proliferation and inhibits the PI3K signaling pathway in HER2-overexpressing tumor cells.

Oligo-fucoidan induces cell cycle arrest, activates caspases, induces apoptosis, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. It also increases the expression of tumor suppressors, such as p53, while decreasing levels of certain tumor promoters. Oligo-fucoidan also promotes the degradation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) receptor and the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It prevents tumor progression, alters tumor microenvironment (TME) and decreases the tumor-promoting M2 macrophages in the TME. Oligo-fucoidan has anti-inflammatory effects that suppress the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and decrease the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (TNFa). This agent may also suppress angiogenic activity by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor expression and VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. As an antioxidant, this agent protects cells against oxidative stress by scavenging superoxide radicals and induces the expression of the anti-oxidant nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and that of its target gene, superoxide dismutase; and prevents reactive oxidative species (ROS) generation in cancer cells and ROS release into the TME.

Upon administration, oncolytic adenovirus ORCA-010 binds to specific Ad3 receptors that are highly expressed on certain tumor cells. This results in the replication of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-delta24 in tumor cells and induces tumor cell lysis which may potentially result in the activation of a systemic immune response against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). The Ad5/3-delta24 has a 24 base pair deletion in constant region 2 of the E1A gene which allows for selective replication in cells that are defective in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A or p16INK4a). As most tumor cells are defective in the Rb/p16 pathway, this virus selectively replicates in these cells. The RGD-4C motif is a 9-amino acid peptide that binds to various and enhances viral-cell receptor binding by allowing for a Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent infection of tumor cells, which is the natural route of viral binding, as CAR expression is often deficient on cancer cells. As integrins are often overexpressed on tumor cell surfaces, integrin receptor binding enhances tumor cells binding and infection by the Ad. The T1 mutation enhances the Ad5 release from tumor cells and promotes spreading throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity. The T1 mutation, a single Adenine insertion at position 445 of the nucleotide sequence of the E3/19K gene of Adenovirus, creates a truncated E3/19K protein that is relocated to the plasma membrane due to the disruption of its ER retention signal. This increases plasma membrane permeability and enhances the release of Ad5.",
            "Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus-1 ONCR-177": "A recombinant, genetically modified, microRNA (miRNA)-attenuated oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. In ONCR-177, a dual bidirectional promoter enables the expression of five different transgenes: the natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell activating cytokine interleuin-12 (IL-12), the chemokines C-C motif chemokine 4 (CCL4) and the extracellular domain of the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG), to allow for expansion and recruitment of classical dendritic cells (DCs), and antagonists to the immune checkpoints programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to counter T cell exhaustion. Upon intra-tumoral administration, the oncolytic HSV-1 ONCR-177 specifically targets, infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells only while not infecting normal, healthy cells. This induces tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles then infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. The released tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells activate the immune system to exert an anti-tumor immune response against the tumor cells, thereby further killing the tumor cells. In addition, the expressed transgenes that are released upon tumor cell lysis induce a systemic tumor-specific immune response and activate NKs, DCs and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) while inhibiting regulatory T-cells (Tregs). This further kills nearby non-infected tumor cells. In ONCR-177, the neurovirulence gene ICP34.5 allows for potent oncolysis, even in the presence of host cell antiviral responses. To ensure selective replication and oncolysis in cancer cells while attenuating replication in healthy tissue, tissue specific miRNA-binding cassettes (miR-T) are inserted into early genes essential for viral replication. In addition, UL37 mutation suppresses latent infection.",

Upon intratumoral administration, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Anti-PD-1 antibody targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",

This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of macrophage activation and phagocytosis of cancer cells. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells.

Upon intravenous administration, opolimogene capmilisbac is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs). The TAAs are subsequently expressed by the APCs and then processed and presented to the immune system by both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules.

PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 consists of three monovalent antibody Fvs specific for PD-L1, HSA and 4-1BB fused in a single chain. Upon administration, PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 simultaneously targets and binds to a membrane-distal epitope of 4-1BB, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. The simultaneous binding to PD-L1 enables clustering of 4-1BB and thereby allows for conditional stimulation of 4-1BB signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME) only upon binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells. 4-1BB activation results in T-cell stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, NM21-1480 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity. HSA fusion prolongs the half-life of NM21-1480. The conditional activation of 4-1BB signaling prevents systemic T-cell activation and lowers toxicity.",

Hsp90, a family of molecular chaperone proteins that are upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, plays a key role in the conformational maturation, stability, and function of \"client\" proteins within the cell,; many of which are involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including kinases, cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors and hormone receptors. As TAS-116 selectively inhibits cytosolic HSP90alpha and beta only and does not inhibit HSP90 paralogs, such as endoplasmic reticulum GRP94 or mitochondrial TRAP1, this agent may have less off-target toxicity as compared to non-selective HSP90 inhibitors.",

Upon oral administration, TPST-1120 targets, binds to and blocks the activity of PPARa, thereby blocking transcription of PPARa target genes leading to an intracellular metabolism shift from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to glycolysis in FAO-dependent tumors and reducing the production of fatty acids in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As fatty acids are essential for tumor cell growth in FAO-dependent tumor cells and are needed for the metabolism of suppressive immune cells in the TME, including regulatory T-cells (Tregs), reducing the amount of fatty acids leads to a direct killing of FAO-dependent tumor cells. It also skews macrophages from the immune suppressive M2 phenotype to an effector M1 phenotype and facilitates the cytotoxicity of immune effector cells, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor immune response and further killing tumor cells. TPST-1120 also restores the natural inhibitor of angiogenesis thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in the TME.

Upon administration of racemetyrosine/methoxsalen/phenytoin/sirolimus SM-88, racemetyrosine, being a dysfunctional and modified form of the non-essential amino acid tyrosine, is specifically taken up by cancer cells through the transporter L-amino acid transferase-1 (LAT1; CD98). As a tyrosine derivative and faulty amino acid protein building block, racemetyrosine prevents protein synthesis in cancer cells. Specifically, this prevents mucin-1 (MUC1) protein synthesis. MUC1 is highly overexpressed by most cancer cells and regulates the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells created from the altered metabolism that cancer cells utilize, by upregulating key antioxidant defenses and preventing ROS-mediated apoptosis. In the absence of MUC1, ROS levels are increased, leading to an increase in oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis. Also, being a protective transmembrane protein, MUC1 is part of the protective layer on the outside of cancer cells and plays a key role in shielding the cancer cell from the immune system. The loss of MUC1 compromises the cell membrane, thereby making the cancer cell more vulnerable to be recognized and attacked by the immune system. Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, increases the cancer cells' need for tyrosine uptake and increases the uptake of racemetyrosine by LAT1. Phenytoin stimulates the release of reactive lipid species by the liver which accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are taken up by cancer cells, thereby further increasing ROS within the cancer cell and increasing oxidative-related apoptosis. Mehoxsalen promotes toxic electron transfer and increases melanin, increases oxidative reactions and production of ROS. This further stimulates oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Normal cells do not regularly take up certain non-essential amino acids, such as tyrosine, but readily convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, so normal healthy cells are not expected to consume racemetyrosine.",

Upon oral administration, SRPK1/ABCG2 inhibitor SCO-101 targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of SRPK1 and ABCG2. Inhibition of the cellular efflux pump ABCG2 by SCO-101 prevents the efflux of co-administered chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells. This may abrogate cancer cell drug resistance and may re-sensitize cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of SRPK1 kinase by SCO-101 inhibits the SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation of splicing factors rich in serine/arginine domains, thereby inhibiting the activation of proteins that are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. This may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. SRPK1 is upregulated in various cancer cell types. Its upregulation is correlated with higher tumor staging, grading, and shorter survival.",

This may lead to a reduction in TGFbR1-dependent proliferation of cancer cells. The TGFb signaling pathway is often deregulated in tumors and plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, invasion, and angiogenesis. It plays a key role in immunosuppression in the TME and cancer cell progression.",

Upon administration, urabrelimab selectively binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages. This prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages. This results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. In addition, blocking CD47 signaling activates both an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response and T cell-mediated killing of CD47-expressing tumor cells. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells.

Upon administration of vibecotamab, this bispecific antibody simultaneously binds to both CD3-expressing T-cells and CD123-expressing cancer cells, thereby crosslinking CD123-expressing tumor cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may result in potent CTL-mediated cell lysis of CD123-expressing tumor cells. CD123, the interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain, is overexpressed in a variety of hematological malignancies; its expression is low or absent in normal hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells.

Although the exact mechanism of action by which this agent inhibits Wee1 has yet to be disclosed, upon administration of ZN-c3, this agent targets and inhibits Wee1. Inhibition of Wee1 promotes both premature mitosis and a prolonged mitotic arrest leading to cell death in susceptible tumor cells, such as p53-deficient or mutated human cancers that lack the G1 checkpoint, upon treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53-deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect. Overexpression of Wee1 occurs in several cancer types and high expression of Wee1 is associated with poor outcomes. Wee1 phosphorylates Cdc2 in the Cdc2/cyclin B (CDK1/cyclin B) complex which blocks progression from G2 into mitosis; it negatively regulates the G2 checkpoint by disallowing entry into mitosis in response to DNA damage.",

Upon oral administration,xevinapant targets and binds to the Smac binding groove on IAPs, including the direct caspase inhibitor X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and the cellular IAPs 1 (c-IAP1) and 2 (c-IAP2). This inhibits the activities of these IAPs and promotes the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, as xevinapant inhibits the activity of IAPs, it may work synergistically with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation to overcome tumor cell resistance to apoptosis. As IAPs regulate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathways, which drives the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, xevinapant may enhance anti-tumor immune responses when administered with certain immunomodulating agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. IAPs are overexpressed by many cancer cell types and suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting active caspases via their baculoviral lAP repeat (BIR) domains.

            "Zandelisib": "An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, zandelisib selectively inhibits the delta isoform of PI3K and prevents the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This both decreases proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells. PI3K-delta plays a key role in the proliferation and survival of hematologic cancer cells. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells. PI3K, an enzyme often overexpressed in cancer cells, plays a crucial role in tumor cell regulation and survival.",
            "Zanidatamab": "An engineered immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) bi-specific monoclonal antibody that targets two different non-overlapping epitopes of the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), ECD2 and ECD4, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, zanidatamab targets and binds to the two distinct HER2 domains on the tumor cell surface. This results in dual HER2 signal blockade, HER2 clustering, receptor internalization and downregulation. This also induces a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) is also induced and further stimulates the immune system to kill HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. The HER2 receptor internalization also further inhibits HER2 activation, HER2-mediated signaling and HER2-mediated tumor cell growth. HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types.",

Zelavespib specifically inhibits active Hsp90, thereby inhibiting its chaperone function and promoting the proteasomal degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival. This may result in the inhibition of cellular proliferation in susceptible tumor cell populations. Hsp90, a molecular chaperone protein, is upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.",

This prevents EGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to both induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",

            "Zotatifin": "A selective inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of zotatifin, this agent targets and binds to elF4A, and promotes eIF4A binding to mRNA with specific polypurine motifs within their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), leading to the formation of a stable sequence-specific ternary complex with eIF4A and mRNA (elF4A- zotatifin-mRNA). This results in the translational repression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, such as KRAS, Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, cyclin D, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 and 2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2), and beta-catenin. The inhibition of the expression of these oncogenes leads to the inhibition of various oncogenic signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. eIF4A, a RNA helicase and the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA duplexes and facilitates 43S ribosome scanning within the 5'-UTR. elF4A is activated by various oncogenic signaling pathways, including RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, and regulates the translation of oncogenes and tumor survival factors with complex secondary structures within the 5'-UTRs that are required for tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis.",
            "Zotiraciclib Citrate": "An orally bioavailable citrate salt form of zotiraciclib a multi-kinase inhibitor for cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) subtypes 1, 2, 7 and 9, Janus-associated kinase 2 (JAK2), FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, FLK2, STK1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, CDK/JAK2/FLT3 Inhibitor TG02 binds to and inhibits the CDK subtypes, JAK2, and FLT3. TG02 also inhibits, to a lesser extent, TYK2, TYRO3, STAT5 and P38delta. This may result in both an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress these kinases. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells, mediates STAT3 activation and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation. FLT3, a class III tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage and acute myeloid leukemias.",

            "Rearrangement": "Any change in the structure of one or more chromosomes.",
            "Repeated Sequences": "Nucleotide sequences present in multiple copies in the genome. There are several types of repeated sequences. Interspersed (or dispersed) DNA repeats (Interspersed Repetitive Sequences) are copies of transposable elements interspersed throughout the genome. Flanking (or terminal) repeats (Terminal Repeat Sequences) are sequences that are repeated on both ends of a sequence, for example, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) on retroviruses. Direct terminal repeats are in the same direction and inverted terminal repeats are opposite to each other in direction. Tandem repeats (Tandem Repeat Sequences) are repeated copies which lie adjacent to each other. These can also be direct or inverted. The ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA genes belong to the class of middle repetitive DNA.",
            "Splice": "Any mutation that occurs within the discrete sequences comprising the 5' or 3' splice sites of a gene that has a spliced message. Splice-site mutation may result in a deletion or insertion of extraneous amino acids in the gene product or a change in the reading frame of the spliced message.",
            "Substitution": "A point mutation occurring within the protein-coding region of a gene, and which codes for a different amino acid than expected.",

The peripheral blood blast count ranges from 20% to 30%.  RAEB-T used to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently, according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following myelodysplastic syndrome).
