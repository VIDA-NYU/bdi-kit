# Change Log


## 0.8.0.dev0 (yyyy-mm-dd)


## 0.7.0 (2025-07-14)

We are pleased to announce the release of bdikit version 0.7.0.
This version brings powerful new capabilities such as the addition of a built-in MCP server for integration with AI agents and new primitives for value matching.

Below is a list of the main changes included in this release:


### New Feature

- **MCP Server:** Introduced an integrated MCP server to enable interaction with BDI-Kit via AI assistants and agent frameworks. ([#122](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/122))
- **Evaluation of Schema and Value Matches:** Added methods to evaluate schema and value matches. ([#118](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/118))
- **Contextual Matching Support:** Enabled users to attach contextual information to source or target datasets to improve matching quality. ([#117](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/117))
- **Caching for Schema Matching:** Implemented a caching mechanism to avoid recomputing expensive match operations. ([#119](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/119))
- **Value Matching Caching:** Added caching support for value matching functions to improve performance and reduce redundant computations. Also enhanced the caching mechanism for schema matching. ([#124](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/124))
- **Numeric Mapping Support:** Introduced a numeric transformer primitive to handle numeric conversions during value matching. ([#112](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/112))


### Enhancement

- **Match Filling Across Matchers:** Improved schema matcher consistency by filling in missing matches across methods. ([#115](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/115))
- **MaxValSim Compatibility:** Updated the `max_val_sim` method to support newer schema and value matcher APIs.
- **Sorting and Completion of Matches:** Matches are now sorted to ensure uniformity across outputs.
- **Magneto as Default Matcher:** Set Magneto as the default schema matcher.
- **Valentine Matching Refinement:** Ensured strict one-to-one matching in Valentine-based matchers.


### API Change

- **LLM Method Renaming:** Renamed LLM-based methods for consistency and improved clarity. ([#121](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/121))
- **Unification of Value Matching Output:** Standardized outputs from value matching methods to align with schema matching formats. ([#116](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/116)) By default, the `match_values()` and `rank_value_matches()` functions now return a single DataFrame instead of a list of DataFrames. Note: This change is backward-incompatible.
- **Terminology Update:** Renamed `'columns'` to `'attributes'` in the outputs of various methods to ensure consistent terminology across the toolkit. ([#123](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/123))


### Fix

- **NaN Handling in Value Matching:** Skipped NaN values in target attributes to avoid runtime errors.
- **Numeric String Handling:** Improved parsing of numbers represented as strings in matching pipelines.
- **GitHub Actions Compatibility:** Updated GitHub Action dependencies to maintain compatibility with Python signing workflows.


### Documentation

- **Table-to-Table Harmonization:** Added a comprehensive example demonstrating how to harmonize entire tables. ([#120](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/120))
- **Quick-Start Guide:** Created a quick-start example to help new users begin using BDI-Kit more easily. ([#111](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/111))
- **Numeric Mapper Documentation:** Documentation of the numeric transformer primitive for numeric data integration.
- **Versioned UI and Docs:** Enhanced the documentation site with version selectors and links. ([#110](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit/pull/110))
